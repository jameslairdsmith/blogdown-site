      <description>The World Universities Debating Championships (WUDC) this year is being hosted at the University of Cape Town (UCT), where I was enrolled for both my undergraduate and postgraduate degrees. For those (like me) who are attending the competition, I thought it would be useful if I published some thoughts on what it will be like once you get there. These thoughts are catalogued below.
Please note that (although I did attend the university for a good long time) this is a decidedly unofficial guide designed for supplementary information only.</description>

      <description>Modern scholars will never be able to read many of the works by the anchient Greeks and Romans. The only way we know of these documents is because of their epitome.
Epitomes are not abridgements, which are selected quotations of a work.
They are also typically longer and deeper than a summary or synopsis, although there is no technical definition to deliniate the length required for one to become the other.</description>

      <description>You experience it every day. You log onto one of many of your newsfeeds and you are innundated with content. But not all of it is the kind of content you want to see. If you are lucky, this uninteresting content will be infrequent enough that it isn&amp;rsquo;t a struggle to simply scroll past it. Regrettably, this isn&amp;rsquo;t always the case; in fact, content has become so ubundent that it&amp;rsquo;s harder and harder to parse it for the kind you are interested in.</description>

      <title>Why I do photography</title>

      <description>I can&amp;rsquo;t remember when it was. I know it was my birthday, but I can&amp;rsquo;t remember which. Reaching these quasi-random calendar dates always provides ample stimulus for introspection. While engulfed in this sentiment, I decided I needed a hobby.
 I&amp;rsquo;m still unclear as to exactly why I thought this; other birthdays had come and gone without such a realisation. Exactly what made me think this is unclear to me now and may have been unlcear to me even then.</description>

      <description>They are are calling it “Day Zero”. From this date, household taps in Cape Town, one of South Africa’s largest cities, will be turned off by officials. Residents will instead have to queue for water at central distribution points. This rationing will be an attempt to prevent Cape Town from being the first major city in the modern world to run out of fresh water.
Exactly when Day Zero will occur is uncertain, but official estimates say it will be sometime in the next three to four months.</description>
