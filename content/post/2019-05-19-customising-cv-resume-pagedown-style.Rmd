This will hopefully be helpful for those looking to make their pagedown CV
look a little nicer, but don't want to have to go through the trial and
error involved in CSS changes.

Here is some CSS that should appear, but not run:

```{css eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
.blocks {
  break-inside: avoid;
}
```

This will get the bullet points to line up nicely:

```{css eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
[data-id="main"] li  {
  margin-left: 20px; 
  list-style-position: inside;
}
```
