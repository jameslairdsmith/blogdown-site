Modern scholars will never be able to read many of the works by the anchient Greeks and Romans. The only way we know of these documents is because of their epitome.

Epitomes are not abridgements, which are selected quotations of a work.

They are also typically longer and deeper than a summary or synopsis, although there is no technical definition to deliniate the length required for one to become the other.

A new kind of epitome has emerged.

Blinkist is perhaps the most well-known. They have x number of subscribers.

The short form kind of reading is also excellent for the spare moments one has during the day, especially with the benefits of the audio tracks. While making a small meal for example or undertaking a short commute. Even if you are preparing a large meal or have a long commute, you may still prefer the mode of reading a few book summariies to simply making progress on a longer book.

The truth is that many non-fiction books are meyandering. They contain precious few nuggests of important information.

But because publishing is more lucrative than writing a long-form blog post, it endures.
