It is well understood that certain types of code are safe while other kinds are considered unsafe. Talking about unsafe code is treacherous however because the word 'unsafe' conjures the idea of it being forbidden.

The truth is that sometimes unsafe code needs to be written. Although the proper precautions can be taken to ensure that it doesn't cause problems. What we need is 

A better word might be something like hazardous. A hazardous road isn't exactly

This might be what you want. The idea might be that you only want unsafe code to be attempted by experts when it's absolutely necessary. 

If you wanted a softer word you could try to re-brand 'unsafe' code as actually being 'hazardous' code. A hazardous road isn't necessarily one that you cannot drive down. You may just need to take extra precautions when you do so. It depends on the message you would like to put out.
