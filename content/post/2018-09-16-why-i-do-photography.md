summary: "I explain my reasons for taking up the hobby"
---

It was the summer of 2014 and I found myself in need of a hobby.

The question may seem strange. You may asked why I need to give particualr reasons for choosing photography. For many people photography is a natural persuit.

Why people have natural inclinations towards certain vocations is an interesting question in itself. Some were introduced to them early in life and subsequently they have become part of what they are. For some, the fact that there parents took part in them is the reason they began.

For me it was different. I didn't start with a natural inclination towards any particualr hobby.

Why did I think I needed one? I'm genuinly still quite unsure. The main reason I guess is that it would provide something perhaps missing from other avenues of life.

I took quite a scientific look at how to choose.

It isn't necessarily the best at every category, but photography has a huge amount of advantages.

## Photography came out on top

Photography travels with you.

Your friends tend to like it.

There is something magical about photography.

It helps you practice technical aptitude. What to do in which situations. What is aperture.

It gives you a greater appreciation of the aesthetic. What places produce the most vivid colors.

### Helps dampen your flaws

For those of us who aren't hugely creative in other avenues of our lives.

Those of us who can be stagnent or reclusive.

## It isn't perfect

It doesn't make you fit, but it can contribute to your fitness.

It can be expensive.
