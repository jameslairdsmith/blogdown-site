summary: "I explain my reasons for taking up the hobby"
---

I can't remember when it was. I know it was my birthday, but I can't remember which. Reaching these quasi-random calendar dates always provides ample stimulus for introspection. While engulfed in this sentiment, I decided I needed a hobby.


> I'm still unclear as to exactly why I thought this; other birthdays had come and gone without such a realisation. Exactly what made me think this is unclear to me now and may have been unlcear to me even then. 

The question of which hobby to choose will seem trival to some, but was not so for me. Parhaps this a symptom of person who overthinks things, but I have often felt there is merit to overthinking thinking this if only for the simple reason that it avoids under-thinking about them.

To start with a blank slate is something different, special.

Regrettably it appears that this is often the case that people sleepwalk into their habits. I include myself in this assesment.

These can be Trogen hobby-horses.

I decided to buy a camera and take up photography, a decision that I am immensely pleased with. My satisfaction is such that it is worthwhile explaining why I made the decision I did and why it has turned out well.

The question may seem trival; after all many people continue and are happy with their chosen hobbies every day. To an extent this is true, but when I set out to find a hobby I didn't do so with a anything particular in mind.

This naturally begs the question as to why photography may be better or worse than any other given hobby and what criteria we may envoke to decide such a question.

In the process of saying why photography is a good choice I will also explain why some other possibilities don't make the cut. 

Preliminaries. Not to make money. Also perhaps different from exercise. Different from things that you have to do. You don't have to exercise.

You may asked why I need to give particualr reasons for choosing photography. For many people photography is a natural persuit.

Why people have natural inclinations towards certain vocations is an interesting question in itself. Some were introduced to them early in life and subsequently they have become part of what they are. For some, the fact that there parents took part in them is the reason they began.

For me it was different. I didn't start with a natural inclination towards any particualr hobby.

Why did I think I needed one? I'm genuinly still quite unsure. The main reason I guess is that it would provide something perhaps missing from other avenues of life.

I took quite a scientific look at how to choose.

It isn't necessarily the best at every category, but photography has a huge amount of advantages.

## We may set out a wishlist for such a system.

Does it provide an avenue for creativity?

Makes you notice the vivid colours of the garden, the clean lines of the city or the motley contrast in the cloudy skies. And makes you yearn to capture it in the net of your lenses. 

Does it have supplementary benefits?

Is it interesting? Can that interest be sustained?

Is it subject to any burdensome constraints?

## Photography came out on top

Photography travels with you.

Your friends tend to like it.

There is something magical about photography.

It helps you practice technical aptitude. What to do in which situations. What is aperture.

It gives you a greater appreciation of the aesthetic. What places produce the most vivid colors.

### Helps dampen your flaws

For those of us who aren't hugely creative in other avenues of our lives.

Those of us who can be stagnent or reclusive.

## It isn't perfect

It doesn't make you fit, but it can contribute to your fitness.

It can be expensive.

## Expansion of other things

Why not simply expand the things that you do?

The first reason may be that your hobby may help with these things.

You may have an interest in diversification. Not all part of your life are likely to go well in unison.

A hobby cannot be a substitute for well being, but it can and does bring a kind of fulfilment that is worth having.

Not all profits are monetary. You can gain profit from getting out more from an activity than you put in.

Spending time on the rooftops of big cities. The quest for good photographs is a parallel quest for the most asesthetic or interesting places.

I may have had hobbies before.
