# Audience Building at the FT
### James Laird-Smith
### 2018/10/10

---




# Core Objectives

--

- Increasing traffic

- Improving quality of traffic

--

- Initiatives
  1. Increasing video views,
  1. Allowing first click free viewing of articles from social media,
  1. Increasing the awareness of gifted articles,
  1. Free viewing of archived articles,
  1. Invite a friend to a free weeks access to the FT,
  1. Display marketing campaign



---

# Analysis approach

- Different mediums have idiosyncratic properties.

- The trick is to ensure comparability of these mediums.

  - Centralisation of data is required.

--

- Try to proxy for three key measures of each initiative.

--

- **Cost**
    - Opportunity cost
    - Actual
  
- **Benefit**
    - Conversion to subscriptions of various types
    - Referrals
  
- **Retention**
  

---

# Tools and techniques

--

- Teasers (free-click, gifted articles, free archive viewing, invite a friend)
  
  - **Cost**: hard to measure, requires placing an oppertunity cost on the articles being read by non-retained users.
  - **Benfit**: conversion simple to measure through the digital platform.
--
    
- Digital marketing: adverts for videos etc.
  
  - **Cost**: simple to measure directly.
  - **Benefit**: conversion can be tricky to measure, but can be understood with Markov Chain Methods.
--

- Non Digital (display marketing):
    
  - **Cost**: simple to measure directly.
  - **Benefit**: conversion difficult to measure
    - Main tools include:
      - signup surveys,
      - promo codes.

# Initiative KPIs

## Simple
  
$$ \text{Short term success KPI} = Benefit - Cost $$

$$ \text{Long term success KPI} = (Benefit \times Retention) - Cost $$

- Caveat: this process may well be non-linear.



## Refined

$$ \frac{\Delta Benefit}{\Delta Cost} $$

---

# Implementation

- Make changes gradually to avoid over-committing to any one intitive.

--

- Don't reduce any initiative to zero.

  - It is difficult to re-establish resources and relationships that are completely dismantled.
  
--

- Usefully, this also works to manage the impact on stakeholders whose initiatives are less effective at present.
  
  - Gives them time to improve it.
  
  - Allows them to transition.
  
    - Ensures staff and moral are retained.
    
    - Ensures they can share their insights and expertise in new teams.

---

# Continuous testing and monitoring

--

- Retention

  - The longer they stay, the greater their Customer Lifetime Value (CLV).
  - Churn can be modelled using Logistic Regression.
  
--

- Targeting

  - Once a person is a subscriber, you can advertise to them if they are at risk of leaving. You can use information on the articles they have viewed to do so based on their interests.
--

- Monitor risk and sustainability of initiatives

  - Changes in policies and competitiveness of the major players (eg. Google, Facebook etc.)
