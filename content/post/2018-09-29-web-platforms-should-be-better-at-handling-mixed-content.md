summary: "Web platforms should be better at handling different categories of content"
---

You experience it every day. You log onto one of many of your newsfeeds and you are innundated with content. But not all of it is the kind of content you want to see. If you are lucky, this uninteresting content will be infrequent enough that it isn't a struggle to simply scroll past it. Regrettably, this isn't always the case; in fact, content has become so ubundent that it's harder and harder to parse it for the kind you are interested in.

People will attribute this to a problem of information overload, but that is misleading. Information has for centuries been more abundent than we can consume. The problem is in fact a problem of information organisation.

Worse still, people don't seem to realise this as a problem.

You are a generator of content. You create things that other people consume.

Web platforms are have done a poor job catering to this fact. You can subscribe people or organisations, but you can only subscribe to them in aggregate. Not only do you not have the option to do this, but they very seldom even have the option to categorise their content.

Twitter would be a good case study, because people are free to follow and unfollow people at will. Imagine a system where one could categorise their tweets as they sent them or in retrospect. And you could then have the option of following only a particular categary of tweets.

Some may complain that this would harm the user experience, but even this is difficult to imagine. The default experience could be exactly as it is now. When you follow somebody, you do so in the normal way, where you get all of their posts (or tweets etc.), but you would then have the option to unfollow certain categories as you see fit.

People are not unidimentional. We will typically have a number of interests and thus a number of things we may tweet or post about. For example, say you follow an academic whose professional work you are interested in; you are grateful for the oppertunity to have their views in your newsfeed. But they also tweet about the local politics in their own country, which you may have no interest in. It isn't that you are particularly disinterested in their local countries politics, you may just not have the time to deal with it. You are then left in the position of having to parse their tweets for the content you are interested in. Everyone you has experienced this in one form or another.
