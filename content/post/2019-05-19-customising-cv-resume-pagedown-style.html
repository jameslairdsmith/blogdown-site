<p>This will hopefully be helpful for those looking to make their pagedown CV
look a little nicer, but donâ€™t want to have to go through the trial and
error involved in CSS changes.</p>
<p>Here is some CSS that should appear, but not run:</p>
<pre class="css"><code>.blocks {
  break-inside: avoid;
}</code></pre>
<p>This will get the bullet points to line up nicely:</p>
<pre class="css"><code>[data-id=&quot;main&quot;] li  {
  margin-left: 20px; 
  list-style-position: inside;
}</code></pre>
